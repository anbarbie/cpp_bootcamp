This repository contains a series of C++ modules that cover various topics and concepts in the C++ programming language. Each module focuses on a specific aspect of C++ and provides learning materials and exercises to enhance your understanding.

## Module 00: Introduction to C++
- Description: This first module introduces the key differences between C and C++ and delves into Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## Module 01: Memory Allocation and Pointers in C++
- Description: This module explores memory allocation, references, pointers to members, and the usage of the switch statement in C++.

## Module 02: Ad-hoc Polymorphism and Overloads in C++
- Description: This module focuses on Ad-hoc polymorphism, function overloading, and the implementation of orthodox canonical classes in C++.

## Module 03: Inheritance in C++
- Description: This module delves into inheritance, its types, and how it enables code reuse and hierarchy in C++.

## Module 04: Subtype Polymorphism and Abstract Classes in C++
- Description: This module covers subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces in C++, emphasizing their role in achieving code flexibility and modularity.

## Module 05: Exception Handling in C++
- Description: This module explores exception handling mechanisms, such as try/catch blocks, and how they help manage and recover from runtime errors in C++.

## Module 06: Type Casting in C++
- Description: This module provides an in-depth understanding of the different types of casts available in C++, including static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, and const_cast.

## Module 07: Templates in C++
- Description: This module focuses on templates, a powerful feature in C++ that allows for generic programming and code reusability.

## Module 08: Templated Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms in C++
- Description: This module explores templated containers, iterators, and algorithms in C++, providing insight into the standard library and its capabilities.

## Module 09: Containers in C++
- Description: This module dives deep into various container types available in C++, such as vectors, lists, stacks, queues, and maps, along with their usage and benefits.
